# How to enable automatic scale breaks for an axis


<p>This example demonstrates how an <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument5803.htm">axis range</a> can be automatically split by <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument6232.htm">scale breaks</a>, if the chart's data suggests their use. To learn about an alternative approach - manual scale breaks creation, refer to <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E1493">How to insert a scale break into an axis</a>.</p><p>Note that both auto-created and manual scale breaks on an axis can co-exist, without affecting the chart's output, in cases where their ranges interfere.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E1493">How to insert a scale break into an axis</a>.</p>
